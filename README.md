I've developed a responsive single-page website featuring dynamic elements.
It includes responsive image displays, a functional form, and a convenient 'scroll back to top' feature.
I've added some text to the page, added a button and updated some text using JavaScript.

The navigation menu allows users to navigate directly to different sections of the page.
Additionally, there's an interactive image gallery that supports navigation using both arrow buttons and mouse scrolling.
Users have the option to easily print out the recipe for their convenience. 

I opted for a black and white color scheme for this page because I understand that when cooking, 
too many colors and distractions can be overwhelming. I believe that simplicity is key when it comes to recipes,
making it easier for users to focus and follow along.

It took me a while to find the right balance for everything on the page with different screen sizes.
